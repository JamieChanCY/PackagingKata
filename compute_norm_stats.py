# 1. generate two groups of 100 data points, one with a mean of 1 and the other with a mean of 1.4, both with sd  of 1.5
from gen_data import generate_random_normal

group2 = generate_random_normal(100, 1.4, 1.5)


# 2. Can we tell that the two groups' populations have different means?
# Print the t statistic and pvalue comparing the two groups

# t =
# p =

# 3. Is the two groups' data correlated with each other?
# print the spaarman correlation statistic and pvalue between the two groups

# r =
# p =


# 4. Plot the data
